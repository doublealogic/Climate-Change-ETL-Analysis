# ETL Project Group 8

## Background
This repository contains a group project that revolved around the concept of ETL (Extracting, Transforming and Loading). We were given a week to select 2 or more sources of data and work closely with our team through all phases of the ETL process. 

## Extract
### Original Data Sources and How Our Data Was Formatted

## Transform
### Data Cleaning/Transformation That Was Required

## Load
### Our Final Database, Tables/Collections, Why This Was Chosen
